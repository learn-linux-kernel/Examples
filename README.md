# Example code for Wiley's "Enterprise Android"

This repository contains a series projects for "Enterprise Android" from Wrox Press.
For questions, please visit the wrox forum at:

http://p2p.wrox.com/book-enterprise-android-programming-android-database-applications-enterprise-751/

The book projects correspond to chapters according to the table below:

1: FragmentFramework

3: KeyValDB

4: KeyValCP, KeyValClient

5: restfulCachingProviderContacts, syncAdapterContacts

6: springServiceContacts, restfulCachingProviderContacts, syncAdapterContacts

7: awsServiceContacts, googleAppEngineContacts

8: Contactscontractexample

10: MigrateContacts, MigrateClinic

11: HumanInterfaceForData

12: AndroidSecurity, springServiceContacts

## Getting the code

The best way to download these examples is by using the Repo tool. If you
are reading the code associated with the Wiley distribution, we strongly
recommend that you install git and begin your work from the code repositories
and keep the code up to date periodically using a "git pull" operation.

Get it like this:
```
curl https://dl-ssl.google.com/dl/googlesource/git-repo/repo > ~/bin/repo
```

Once repo is installed, download this source with the following commands:

```
repo init -u https://github.com/wileyenterpriseandroid/manifests.git
repo sync
```

You can download the source without using repo, with the following two commands:

```
git clone https://github.com/wileyenterpriseandroid/migrate-sdk.git
git clone https://github.com/wileyenterpriseandroid/Examples.git ea-examples
```

The README files in each project directory provide the best source of instructions for running their associated project.

## Android Setup

About half of these projects are Android projects.  In order to work with them,
you will need the Android SDK.  Projects were tested with Android SDK v 22.0.1.
They have not been tested with Android Studio.  Instructions for setting up an
Android  development environment are here:

http://developer.android.com/sdk/index.html

You will, of course, need a working Java.  All projects were tested with Java 6.
Most were tested with Java 7 as well.

###

## Using Eclipse
Most projects will build in Eclipse.  To create an Eclipse project for one of the code directories here,
run the following commands, from the command line, while in each project root:
```shell
cp tools/ide/eclipse/classpath .classpath
cp tools/ide/eclipse/project .project
```

This will copy the necessary eclipse configuration into the project directory.  Once you have done that
you will be able to Import > General > Import Existing Project into Workspace.

The following Android projects contain a Windows script in their tools directory for
completing the above task for Eclipse:

    KeyValClient
    KeyValCP
    KeyValDB
    MigrateClinic
    MigrateContacts
    restfulCachingProviderContacts
    syncAdapterContacts

The following service projects contain an ant build script:

    springServiceContact
    springSyncServiceContacts
    awsServiceContacts
    googleAppEngineContacts

In order to set them up as eclipse projects, use the "eclipse" target, like this:

```shell
ant eclipse
```

The project README files in the projects document this step.

Warning: Some chapter descriptions say to copy tools/build.xml to the main
project directory, and then run ant eclipse. Late in the development of the
book, we changed this setup somewhat so that you can now run the following
command:

```shell
cd $CODE/<projectRoot>
ant -f tools/eclipse.xml
```

Which will then copy the relevant files into place.

===

Some of the projects require special eclipse extentions (WTP - Web Tools Platform, Ivy, etc.).  See the
README file in the project for specifics.
